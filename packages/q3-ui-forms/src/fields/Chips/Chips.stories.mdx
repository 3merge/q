# Chips

Use Chips to suggest or control an input otherwise suitable
for Multi-Text entry. Whenever you need to select from a big
(potentially dynamic list), use Chips over Checkset or
Multi-Select.

## Lazy-loading options

Although Chips can take an _options_ array, much like Select
or Checkset, it's often preferable to lazy-load results. If
you'd like to only fetch once, specify _preload_ to avoid
subsequent network calls on change.

  <Story name="Lazy load">
    <Form>
      <Field
        type="chips"
        name="demo"
        loadOptions={autocomplete}
        helperText="Options include Canada, United States and United Kingdom"
      />
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Free-solo text entry

When Chips needs to be more suggestive, add the _freeSolo_
prop to enable users to enter anything they choose.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Free-solo">
    <Form>
      <Field
        type="chips"
        name="demo"
        preload
        loadOptions={autocomplete}
        freeSolo
      />
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Preview>
