<h2>ðŸ”¨ Builders</h2>
<p>Initially, the builders' folder contained mostly wrappers and executor-type components. Each served to connect one or many form fields to the authorization and validation state. Eventually, this evolved into a suite of tools for enhancing (or monkey-patching) Formik. Now, all necessary components to build a form exist in this directory.</p>
